# AnnualWeather
AUTHOR: Briana Berger
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The program uses a weather data set of Gainesville, FL for 12 months. With the data, the program provides the user the information in a clean structure and prints the information according to the user's preference for temperature scale and precipitation scale. 
VERSION or DATE: 12/23/2017
DIFFICULTIES: I had a hard time figuring out how to use printf, but once I practiced a bit more, I got the hand of it. 
LEARNING MOMENTS: I learned a lot from this lesson, especially in terms of small little mistakes. For example, when using printf to print out all the index values for the data chart, I by accident put quotation marks around the array[index]. Or when I forgot to round my index values. Each little mistake allowed me to become more meticulous in my work.
WHAT I ENJOYED: It was fun trying out new things and debugging the program.
